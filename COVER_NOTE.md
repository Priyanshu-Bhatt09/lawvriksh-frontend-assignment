## PR Summary: Promage Dashboard Implementation & Analysis

This project delivers a high-fidelity React frontend for the "Promage" project management dashboard, built from a Figma design. The work was split into two phases.

**Phase 1: UI Implementation**
This phase involved the complete build-out of the user interface. The design was broken down into modular React components (e.g., `Sidebar`, `StatCard`, `ProjectSummary`). The layout is fully responsive, using a 12-column CSS Grid for precise alignment. All styling (colors, fonts, shadows, radii) was sampled from the Figma design and implemented via global CSS variables for a clean, pixel-perfect result. All data is statically mocked, as no backend was required.

**Phase 2: Documentation & UX Rationale**
This phase focused on documenting the "why" behind the design.
* A `README.md` was created with setup instructions and an analysis of the core UX laws (Fitts's, Hick's, Jakob's) that make the design intuitive.
* A `PHASE_NOTES.md` file was added to map specific micro-interactions (e.g., hover states, active links) to their implementation and their purpose in providing user feedback and improving usability.

This implementation is a complete, static, and well-documented representation of the original design.
